This lecture introduces within-subjects designs as a methodological alternative to between-groups designs. In between-groups designs, each participant contributes data under only one condition, making individual differences a major source of variability. In contrast, within-subjects designs test each participant in all conditions, comparing individuals to themselves. This approach reduces participant-related noise and increases statistical power while requiring fewer participants.

Several specific types of within-subjects designs were discussed. Pretest-posttest designs measure participants before and after an intervention; repeated-measures designs involve multiple conditions within the same session; and longitudinal designs track change across extended time periods. Key benefits include reduced nuisance variability and improved efficiency. However, these advantages come with potential challenges. Participants may deduce the study’s purpose (demand characteristics) or experience carryover effects, where performance in one condition influences subsequent performance. Carryover effects include fatigue (declining performance), practice (improvement over time), history (external events), maturation (developmental or aging changes), and testing effects (familiarity with the test).

Order effects—when the sequence of conditions influences outcomes—present another limitation. Researchers address these via counterbalancing, systematically varying or randomizing the order of conditions across participants. Techniques for complete counterbalancing include ABBA or block randomization designs, where participants complete all possible condition orders. When this is impractical, incomplete counterbalancing methods such as random order with rotation or Latin-square designs ensure each condition appears in every position and follows every other condition equally often.

In cognitive science, researchers often intermix conditions randomly across many trials to eliminate order effects, unless the task would be confusing or lengthy. Despite its strengths, counterbalancing has limits—it cannot reverse irreversible manipulations such as drug administration, surgery, or one-time experiences. Overall, within-subjects designs provide efficient, powerful means to detect effects while demanding careful control of order and carryover influences.
