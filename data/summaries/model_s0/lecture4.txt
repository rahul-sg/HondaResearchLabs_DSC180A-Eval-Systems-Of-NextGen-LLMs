This lecture explored how natural selection and genetic inheritance explain evolutionary change. Evolution was defined as the change in allele frequencies within a population over time, grounded in Darwin’s postulates that populations face competition for existence, possess heritable variation, and experience differential survival and reproduction. Although Darwin struggled to explain the source and maintenance of variation, subsequent discoveries in genetics provided the missing mechanisms. Artificial selection in domesticated plants and animals demonstrated how selective breeding can produce rapid, observable evolutionary changes.

Gregor Mendel’s 19th-century experiments with pea plants established the particulate theory of inheritance, showing that traits are determined by discrete “particles” (genes) passed from parent to offspring, maintaining variation across generations. His ideas resurfaced in the early 1900s, connecting inheritance to structures inside cells. Walther Flemming identified chromatin and mitosis, while Sutton and Boveri proposed the Chromosome Theory of Inheritance, linking chromosomes directly to Mendelian factors.

Cell division occurs through mitosis, producing identical diploid somatic cells, and meiosis, which generates haploid gametes. During meiosis, recombination and independent assortment introduce genetic variation. Mendel’s further findings distinguished genotype from phenotype and demonstrated how dominant and recessive alleles interact to determine traits. Crossing heterozygotes and analyzing outcomes through Punnett squares illustrated predictable inheritance patterns. Linkage, recombination, and crossing over explained how genes on different or nearby chromosomes assort independently or together, with recombination rates indicating the likelihood of genetic exchange.

The discovery of DNA’s double-helix structure by Watson and Crick, building on Rosalind Franklin’s x-ray data, revealed the molecular basis of heredity. DNA consists of a sugar-phosphate backbone and complementary base pairs (A–T, C–G). Genes are functional sequences of DNA, some forming mitochondrial DNA inherited maternally. mtDNA, shorter and more conserved than nuclear DNA, allows estimation of evolutionary relationships, such as identifying “Mitochondrial Eve,” the most recent matrilineal ancestor of all humans roughly 100,000–200,000 years ago in Africa.
