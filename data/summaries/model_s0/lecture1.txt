The opening lectures introduce the foundations of financial accounting as the “language of business,” emphasizing its dual role: recording a firm’s economic activities and communicating that information to decision makers. Accounting translates the story of a company’s successes, challenges, and risks into measurable data used by investors, creditors, management, suppliers, employees, and regulators. The course focuses on understanding how financial statements are created and interpreted to support sound business decisions, distinguishing this from managerial accounting and financial statement analysis.  

Financial accounting organizes information about three types of activities—financing, investing, and operations—into key reports: the balance sheet, income statement, statement of stockholders’ equity, and statement of cash flows. These statements are prepared under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), which ensure consistency and comparability. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) oversees public firms’ reporting and delegates standard-setting to the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). Globally, the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) issues International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). Independent auditors add credibility by verifying that financial statements follow GAAP, issuing opinions ranging from unqualified (clean) to adverse (rarely issued).  

The lectures then explore the balance sheet in detail. The balance sheet reports a company’s financial position at a specific date through the accounting equation: Assets = Liabilities + Stockholders’ Equity. Assets are resources providing future benefit; liabilities are obligations owed to creditors; and equity represents owners’ residual claims. Transactions always have dual effects to maintain balance. Examples using a start-up company illustrate financing through stock issuance and bank loans, investing in equipment and prepaid assets, and purchasing supplies on credit. The lecture concludes with classification principles: assets and liabilities are divided into current (within one year) and noncurrent categories, listed by liquidity or maturity. Equity reflects contributed capital (common stock) and retained earnings. Collectively, these concepts establish the framework for analyzing how companies generate, use, and report financial resources.
