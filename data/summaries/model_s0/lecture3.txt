This lecture explored Aníbal Quijano’s concept of the “coloniality of power,” situating it within the broader Modernity/Coloniality/Decoloniality (MCD) research framework. Quijano, a Peruvian sociologist, developed key ideas linking colonialism, capitalism, and epistemology. The lecture emphasized that modernity and coloniality are intertwined: European expansion not only reshaped global economies but also constructed systems of racial hierarchy and knowledge that privileged Eurocentric worldviews while marginalizing non-Western epistemologies.  

The “coloniality of power” refers to how colonial domination persisted beyond formal colonialism through racialized labor systems, such as slavery, the encomienda, and the mita, which organized global capitalism. These economic and social structures embedded racial difference into global hierarchies of wealth, citizenship, and knowledge production. Eurocentrism, therefore, became a dominant mode of thinking that naturalized whiteness and Western superiority. This ideology shaped narratives of modernity as a linear progression from “primitive” to “developed,” legitimizing inequality under the guise of progress.  

The lecture also connected these ideas to politics and culture in Latin America, showing how independence movements and national identities often reproduced colonial logics. Rebecca Earle’s discussion of “Indianesque nationalism” illustrated how elites used idealized Indigenous symbols to craft distinct national identities while excluding actual Indigenous peoples. The later ideology of mestizaje, presented through art and public imagery, claimed to promote racial harmony but often upheld Eurocentric hierarchies by privileging whiteness and assimilation.  

Bringing these themes forward, examples such as Alfonso Cuarón’s *Roma* highlighted the persistence of colonial and racial dynamics in modern media. Quijano’s call for decoloniality urges delinking from Eurocentric frameworks and centering alternative knowledges, languages, and cosmologies. Ultimately, the lecture framed decolonial thought as both critique and praxis—an ongoing effort to undo the intellectual and material legacies of colonialism in the Americas.
