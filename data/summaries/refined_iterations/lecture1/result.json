  "refined_summary": "Financial accounting is introduced as the language of business\u2014an information system for recording, measuring, and communicating a company\u2019s economic activities. It conveys a firm\u2019s financial story\u2014its performance, opportunities, and risks\u2014in quantitative form so that investors, creditors, suppliers, managers, employees, boards of directors, customers, and others can make informed decisions. The discipline serves two main functions: recordkeeping (capturing and valuing economic events) and communication (providing information to external decision makers). The course distinguishes financial accounting from managerial accounting, which focuses on internal decisions, and from financial statement analysis, which uses existing financial reports for valuation.\n\nThe financial accounting framework organizes a company\u2019s activities into three categories: **financing** (transactions with owners and creditors that provide funding), **investing** (acquiring and disposing of resources needed for operations), and **operating** (the day\u2011to\u2011day activities of producing and selling goods or services). These activities underlie the four primary financial statements\u2014the balance sheet, income statement, statement of stockholders\u2019 equity, and statement of cash flows\u2014that together communicate how resources are obtained and used. Reports are prepared according to **Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP)** so that accounting information is consistent and comparable. The **Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)** oversees reporting by publicly traded firms, requires periodic filings such as the annual Form\u202f10\u2011K, quarterly Form\u202f10\u2011Q, and event\u2011driven Form\u202f8\u2011K, and delegates standard\u2011setting authority to the **Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)**. Internationally, the **International Accounting Standards Board (IASB)** establishes analogous guidance under IFRS. Independent **auditors**, required for public companies, evaluate whether statements comply with GAAP and are free of material misstatement, issuing opinions that add credibility for decision makers.\n\nThe balance sheet illustrates the core accounting equation\u2014**Assets\u202f=\u202fLiabilities\u202f+\u202fStockholders\u2019\u202fEquity**\u2014which portrays a company\u2019s financial position at a specific date and must always stay in balance. Assets are resources expected to yield future benefits; liabilities are obligations to outsiders; and stockholders\u2019 equity represents owners\u2019 residual claims after debts are settled. Every transaction produces equal dual effects to maintain equilibrium. The Klein,\u202fInc. example demonstrates this process: initial financing through stock issuance and a bank loan increases both assets and claims; investing in equipment or prepaying rent reallocates asset types without changing totals; and purchasing supplies on credit raises both assets and liabilities. Together, these examples show how financing, investing, and operating events shape a firm\u2019s resources and obligations while preserving the accounting equation. Understanding this structure provides the foundation for interpreting all financial statements and evaluating a company\u2019s overall financial health.",
