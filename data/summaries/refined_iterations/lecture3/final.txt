This lecture expanded on Aníbal Quijano’s concept of the *coloniality of power* within the broader Modernity/Coloniality/Decoloniality (MCD) framework. The MCD project argues that modernity, coloniality, and decoloniality are interlinked: Western modernity emerged alongside colonial domination; coloniality exposes how power and knowledge were organized through that domination; and decoloniality seeks to recover suppressed epistemologies and ways of being.  

A Peruvian sociologist, Quijano traced how the conquest of the Americas simultaneously produced new racial hierarchies and new systems of labor control, establishing a global model of capitalist dependency. Race, constructed as a “mental category” of modernity, divided humanity into “superior” and “inferior” groups, legitimizing exploitation through systems like slavery, encomienda, and mita. This racialized order became embedded in global capitalism, determining who could access spaces, privileges, and authority.  

Eurocentrism, for Quijano, naturalized this hierarchy by positioning Europe as the universal standard of knowledge, progress, and civilization. Linking his argument to Stuart Hall’s *“West and the Rest”* discourse, the lecture showed how Eurocentrism relied on binary oppositions—civilized/primitive, developed/underdeveloped, First/Third World—to rationalize conquest and modernization. These ideas shaped economic, political, and cultural theories of democracy and development that continued to privilege whiteness and European norms long after formal colonialism ended.  

The lecture then traced how these patterns informed Latin American national identities. Drawing on Rebecca Earle’s study of “Indianesque nationalism,” it illustrated how post‑independence elites romanticized a distant Indigenous past to claim local authenticity while excluding living Indigenous peoples. The later ideology of *mestizaje* framed racial mixing as unity but reproduced Eurocentric ideals of whiteness and assimilation—visualized in works such as Modesto Brocos’s *The Redemption of Ham*. Film analyses like Alfonso Cuarón’s *Roma* further revealed how colonial hierarchies of race, labor, and representation persist within modern social structures.  

In class, the portfolio exercise guided students to identify and analyze key passages from Quijano’s essay, connecting textual evidence to themes of coloniality of power and Eurocentrism. Through these applications, the lecture emphasized that colonial legacies shape both historical and contemporary imaginations of race, nation, and modernity.  

Quijano’s concluding call for *decoloniality* urged breaking free from the “Eurocentric mirror” that distorts self‑understanding. Decolonial thinking centers non‑Western epistemologies, languages, and cosmologies, proposing a plural vision of modernities capable of dismantling the enduring matrix of power and knowledge forged through colonialism.
