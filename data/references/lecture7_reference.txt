The lecture begins by contrasting between-groups designs, where different participants are compared across conditions, with within-subjects designs, where each participant is compared to themselves across conditions. Within-subjects designs reduce nuisance variability caused by individual differences and require fewer participants to achieve the same statistical power. In a between-groups design, each participant contributes data to only one condition, which increases noise and requires larger sample sizes. In a within-subjects design, every participant completes all conditions, which lowers participant-related noise and increases efficiency.

Several types of within-subjects designs are introduced, including pretest–posttest designs with measurements taken before and after an intervention, repeated-measures designs with two or more experimental conditions, and longitudinal designs that involve multiple measurements over time. The benefits include needing fewer participants and producing more powerful tests due to reduced variability. The lecture then outlines important concerns such as demand characteristics, where participants may infer the purpose of the study, and carryover effects such as fatigue and practice effects. Additional threats include history effects, maturation effects, and testing effects, all of which can influence outcomes independent of the manipulation.

Order effects are introduced as a major issue when condition sequence influences performance. Examples involving children’s speech perception and dyslexia research illustrate how order can confound results. To address this problem, the lecture introduces counterbalancing as a method for varying condition order across participants. Complete counterbalancing is discussed using ABBA designs for two conditions and block randomization for three or more conditions. Incomplete counterbalancing methods such as random order with rotation and Latin square designs are presented as more practical alternatives when full counterbalancing is not feasible.

The lecture concludes with additional considerations for cognitive science research, including whether to intermix trials to reduce order effects and the limits of counterbalancing in situations where experiences cannot be reversed, such as drug administration, surgeries, learned memory strategies, or exposure to media.
